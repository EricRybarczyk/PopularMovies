Project 2 From Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO REVIEWERS**

This app requires YOU to provide a valid API Key from The Movie DB, https://www.themoviedb.org

After opening the project in Android Studio, you must add a "raw" Resource Directory and then
a plain text file named "apikey.txt" in the "raw" directory. The "apikey.txt" file must contain
your API Key value as the **only content in the file.**

Udacity warned against including our own API Key within the distributed source code, 
and therefore you must add your own API Key to run the app. This guidance from Udacity is
